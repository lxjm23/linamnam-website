      <p className="sub-heading">To place an order with Linamnam, simply message us on our Facebook page or in our WhatsApp with your desired menu items, the date of your order, and specify whether it's for pick-up or delivery. Please note that for delivery orders, there is an additional fee of $20, unless the order totals $300 or more, in which case delivery is free. All orders must be placed and confirmed at least 5 days in advance of the pick-up or delivery date to ensure availability.  To confirm your order, a deposit of half the total order price is required upon confirmation. This deposit secures your order and ensures that we can prepare your dishes with care. The remaining half of the order total can be paid upon pick-up or delivery.  We accept payments via cash or bank transfer. For bank transfers, kindly provide proof of payment upon confirmation of your order. If you have any questions or special requests, feel free to message us, and our team will be happy to assist you. Thank you for choosing Linamnam for your culinary needs!</p>
